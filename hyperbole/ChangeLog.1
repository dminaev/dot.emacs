* kotl/kview.el (kview:insert-contents): 
	        (kcell-view:create): Moved call to kfile:narrow-to-kcells

    hsite.el.

    "Hyperbole mail buttons accepted" comment to outgoing mail messages if

* kotl/kotl.el (kotl-data:to-kcell-v2): 
               (kotl-data:to-kcell-v3): Rewrote to repair cells on the fly
    where the cell data saved in the outline is nil.  This would only
    happen if there is a bug in the kproperty code, but we still want
    people to be able to read in outlines without error in such a case.

* kotl/kprop-em.el (kproperty:put): Rewrote to prevent inheritance of
   the added property by characters inserted following the region to which
   the property is added.  This inheritance caused bugs in the cell

    position.

    cells when kotl-mode:refill-flag is non-nil.

* kotl/kproperty.el: Separated into two separate implementation files.
    kprop-em.el for Emacs 19
    kprop-xe.el for XEmacs
* MANIFEST:
* Makefile (EL_KOTL, ELC_KOTL): Added references to new kprop-* files.

Tue Jun 20 10:54:18 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@mot.com>

                    (kotl-mode:promote-tree): With prefix ARG = 0, cells

    than when each cell must be refilled.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:move): Optimized to skip mapping over a tree to

    than having Makefile hard-code the Hyperbole path.  This will only
    work under versions of Emacs 19, however.  Emacs 18 users should set

    files, not all elc files.  all-elc now does that.

Thu Feb 16 13:32:03 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

    to VISIBLE-P to match kcell-view:next/previous functions.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Made kotl-mode commands which
    override standard editing commands also inherit the property lists from
    their respective standard command symbols.  So, for example, commands
    which use the pending-delete property under XEmacs will be compatible.

                    (kotl-mode:split-cell): Changed to delete any
    whitespace preceding point before splitting cell, so do not end up
    with excess whitespace at the end of the preceding cell.

Tue Feb 14 12:13:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@footloose>

* kotl/kfill.el (filladapt-prefix-table): Tightened hanging indent pattern

* wrolo.el (rolo-next-match): 
           (rolo-previous-match): Added (let ((case-fold-search t))) since

* hsite-ex.el (and hyperb:lemacs-p window-system): XEmacs 19.12 and above
    sets window-system = 'tty if running on a dumb terminal so that it can
    still display faces.  But testing for a color display will fail since
    this requires an X display right now, so added a (not (eq
    window-system 'tty) in this case.

Mon Jan 30 18:50:22 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@footloose)

* hactypes.el (hyp-config): Updated to use system-configuration variable
    when available.

Wed Jan 25 17:33:26 1995  Bob Weiner  (weiner@footloose)

    function to show first line of all cells.  Also added to Otl> menu as
    'Overview' command. 
    Also added kotl-mode:top-cells bound to {C-c C-t} which does what
    kotl-mode:hide-body used to, show only top cells.

                    (kotl-mode:mark-whole-buffer): Added to overload
    standard command.

                    (kotl-mode:backward-paragraph):

                    (kotl-mode:forward-paragraph): Redefined to only move
    a paragraph within a cell, not a cell at a time.

Fri Dec 16 20:04:45 1994  Bob Weiner  <bweiner@sun29>

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Modified to support Lisp expression return values
    from hpath:find-program.

    hpath:rfc is a remote pathname.

    tags-file-name when truly needed.
               (smart-key-alist): Added handler for view-less mode used
    with XEmacs and re-arranged clauses so that view mode can be used to
    display man pages.

    replacement for c-mode.

  hui-em19-b.el
  hui-ep19-b.el (hproperty:set-item-highlight): Updated to alter
    rolo-highlight-face if it matches hproperty:highlight-face.
* wrolo.el (rolo-grep-file): Removed call to
    hproperty:set-item-highlight.  Instead done once when wrolo.el is loaded.
           (rolo-highlight-face):  Updated initial setting expression.

    button source location, if a pathname.  This makes constructs
    like the following work when the 2nd line is activated:

	 lisp-local/hypb/hactypes.el:145:    (require 'comint))

* hmail.el (hmail:compose): Fixed to allow empty string subject lines.

           (rolo-match-regexp): Added to store last search expression.
           (rolo-next-match): Added and bound to {TAB} in rolodex
    match buffer.  Moves point to next match.

    rolodex match buffer.  Moves point to previous match.
           (rolo-display-matches): Added (run-hooks 'wrolo-display-hook)
    to affect match buffer after a search has been done and matches have
    been inserted.  Also, now that the match buffer has a real mode,
    changed so that point is left in the match buffer after a search.  {q}
    will quit.
           (rolo-quit): Added to quit from rolodex match buffer and to
    restore frame display.  Bound to {q}.

   (hsite-ex.el):
   (hui-le-but.el): Renamed to hui-xe-but.el since Lemacs was renamed to XEmacs.

Fri Sep 30 12:12:58 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

    InfoDock, a modified version of XEmacs which uses shell rather than
    comint mode.

Thu Sep 22 11:53:04 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun29)

* htz.el (htz:date-parse): Modified to parse dates from an 'ls -l' command.

* hmouse-drv.el (smart-key-help-show): Nullified emacs-lisp-mode-hook when
    help buffer is put into emacs-lisp-mode since if this hook turned on
    font-locking in XEmacs 19.11, it could cause the editor to hang.

Wed Aug 31 12:54:00 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

* hypb.el (require 'hact): Added for action: functions which are used in there.
    This fixed a bug where Hyperbole was autoloaded, hvm.el was loaded and
    then called hypb:function-overload which invoked action:params without
    doing a (require 'hact).

* README:
  hypb.texi:
  DEMO: Changed references to 'Lucid Emacs' to 'XEmacs', the new name.

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): A kotl link may be passed to this function.  It
  may contain multiple components following a comma after the pathname, so
  strip this before checking pathname validity.

  expand a link pathname with an environment variable in it.

Tue Aug 30 19:28:58 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

   configurations by name.
  hui-menus.el (hui:menus): Added Win/ submenu for both name and ring wconfig
    commands.
  hyperbole.el: Added autoloads for new wconfig functions.  Commented out key
    bindings for wconfig commands since a larger set of commands is now
    available through the Win/ menu.
  hypb.texi: Documented new wconfig functions.

Thu Aug 25 17:27:48 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

* set.el (set:replace): Added to replace elements in sets whose elements
    look like (key . value).
         (set:get): Added to return value associated with a key from a set.

* hactypes.el (link-to-file): Changed to allow non-existing paths so that
    ange-ftp pathnames are not checked.

Fri Jul 22 13:57:35 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

    use hyperb:window-system value in here.

* hibtypes.el (cscope): Added this new type to jump to source lines
    associated with output from the USL cscope C/C++ flow analysis tool.

Wed Jul 20 13:48:09 1994  Bob Weiner  (bweiner@sun285)

* hyperbole.el (hypb:read-only-smart-keys): 
    Changed oversight bug:
	  (define-key dired-mode-map smart-key-read-only 'smart-dired)
    to:
	  (define-key dired-mode-map smart-key-read-only 'smart-key)

Sat Jun 25 21:29:32 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun314)

* hmouse-drv.el (smart-key-operate): Added error message triggered if no
    mouse support available, then drag actions cannot be performed, even from
    the keyboard.

Tue Jun 21 12:11:07 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hactypes.el (link-to-rfc): Updated to new standard RFC ftp site.

* hargs.el (hargs:completion): Removed leading space from *Completion*
    buffer name for Emacs V19.

Thu Jun 16 01:04:49 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hmouse-drv.el: Added (require 'hsite) to commands which may be
    autoloaded to ensure that smart-key-alist from "hui-mouse.el" gets
    defined and the rest of the Hyperbole system can be used.

* hyperbole.el (hypb:read-only-smart-keys): Replaced old GNUS symbol names
    with GNUS V4 ones.  This was an oversight.
               (defact): 
               (defib): Added autoloads for these so users can define own types.

* hpath.el (hpath:www-at-p): Fixed regexp bug that could lead to extra
    long invalid button labels.
  README:  Fixed format of WWW ftp: path so it would work properly.

* hyperbole.el (load-path): Added an nreverse call after set:create to
    keep it from reversing order of load-path entries.

==============================================================================
V3.14 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* hversion.el (hyperb:version): Updated to V3.13.

* Makefile: Added for automated install and rebuilding of Hyperbole.
  MANIFEST: Added Makefile entry.
  README:   Updated installation instructions to use make.
  hsite-ex.el:

Wed Jun 15 00:48:51 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hactypes.el (exec-shell-cmd): 
  	      (exec-window-cmd): If default-directory is a remote ange-ftp
    pathname, don't try to cd to it before executing the shell command.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Fixed bug in handling pathnames that begin with
    special character '&', which means execute the filename as a
    window-based program.
           (hpath:find-program): Added copy of remote ange-ftp pathnames
    to local storage so that external viewer programs get a pathname that
    they can reach.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-cell): 
                    (kotl-mode:fill-paragraph): Added
    (kotl-mode:to-valid-position) calls at end since point may otherwise
    end up in a non-editable region of the outline.

* hyperbole.el (vm-mode-hooks): Commented out Hyperbole support for Vm
    since it doesn't work with current versions.

Tue Jun 14 11:58:55 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hactypes.el (exec-kbd-macro): Rewrote to translate Lucid Emacs events
    into printable key sequence strings for storage as a macro definition.
    But since Lemacs insert-kbd-macro function is broken as of V19.10,
    this only works for certain macros under Lemacs.

* hyperbole.el: Added (require 'hvar) so that var:append is defined.

* hmouse-key.el: Moved common functions from "hmouse-sh.el" and
    "hmouse-reg.el" back in here.  No need to duplicate them.

* hmouse-sh.el
  hmouse-reg.el (sm-mouse-get-bindings): Fixed lemacs key names which
    needed [] around them.
                (sm-mouse-setup): Changed to only set
    sm-mouse-previous-bindings (mouse key bindings prior to Hyperbole use)
    if not already set.

Mon Jun 13 12:44:18 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

==============================================================================

Fri Jun 10 00:13:31 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:move-before/after): Added error check if
    try to move a tree to within itself.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el: Fixed bug in many next/prev type commands that did
    not change a negative arg sent to the next command to a positive arg
    when sent to the prev command for handling.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:default-label-min-width): Raised from 3 to 4 so
    that idstamps up to 0999 display correctly in level 1 cells.
                (kcell-view:operate): Changed first arg from an
    sexpression to a function so can byte-compile the function passed in.

Wed Jun  8 18:44:01 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:kill-tree): Added an optional arg, the
    number of trees to kill forward from point.
                    (kotl-mode:first-cell-p): Added.
                    (kotl-mode:last-cell-p): Added.

Tue Jun  7 18:39:39 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hyperbole.el: Moved message system hook settings here from hsite-ex.el
    so that they are activated if Hyperbole is autoloaded.

Sat Jun  4 17:12:15 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@localhost)

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:exchange-cells)
                    (kotl-mode:transpose-cells):  Added.
                    (kotl-mode-map): Added {C-c e} and {C-c t} key
  bindings for these new commands.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:contents): Rewrote to handle collapsed cells.
                (kcell-view:expand): Added to expand cell contents.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:insert-buffer): 
                    (kotl-mode:insert-file): 
    Added to overload standard functions.

Thu Jun  2 19:40:56 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hargs.el (hargs:iform-read): Added support for '@' and '_' initial
    interactive specification characters.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:copy-to-register): 
                    (kotl-mode:insert-register): 
    Added to overload standard functions.

    Also added (setq zmacs-region-stays t) to movement commands so they
    do not deselect the region under Lemacs.

Wed Jun  1 21:47:33 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hbdata.el (hbdata:apply-entry): Rewrote this function and its calls to
    pass in a function rather than an sexpr, so the function body can be
    byte-compiled.

    Also fixed so that mail conditionals are only tested
    if key-src is a buffer, which implies source buffer is a mail or news
    buffer.  This prevents these conditionals from triggering when a
    global button is invoked from a mail/news buffer, since its key-src
    will be a buffer name, not a buffer.

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Removed item-array internal variable which
    was being used improperly as an obarray into which symbols were
    interned.  This caused the function to fail whenever there were two or
    more link type possibilities.

* hib-doc-id.el (link-to-doc): Added error message for user feedback if an
    online document path is found but the path is invalid.

Mon May 30 00:36:56 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:transpose-chars): 
                    (kotl-mode:transpose-words): 
    Added to overload standard functions.

* hmouse-drv.el (smart-key-mouse):
                (smart-key-mouse-meta): Make this a no-op if some local mouse
    key binding overrode its associated global depress binding so that the
    Smart Keys do not interfere with local bindings.

* hmouse-sh.el - Added to bind Smart Keys to shift-middle and shift-right. 
  hmouse-reg.el - Renamed from hmouse-key.el; can be used instead of
    hmouse-sh.el to bind Smart Keys to middle and right mouse buttons.
  hmouse-key.el - Wrapper file which loads hmouse-sh.el by default.
  hypb.texi - Updated to reflect shift Smart Key bindings.

* DEMO - Rewrote to use Action and Assist Key terminology.

Wed May 18 19:35:23 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hsite-ex.el (hpath:find-alist): Added display support for the following image
    file formats using the 'xv' program: gif, tiff, xbm, pm, pbm, and jpeg.
    Added a blurb about this in "DEMO".

Tue May 17 19:05:43 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui-window.el (sm-mouse-x/y-coord): Modified emacs19 section to use
    posn-col-row since event reporting changed from character positions to
    pixels in V19.23.

Mon May  9 12:22:16 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hmouse-drv.el: Added (require 'hypb) since hypb:window-list is called in here.

Sun May  8 14:16:34 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@localhost)

* hversion.el (sm-window-sys-term):
              (hyperb:window-system): Moved from "hmouse-key.el" so would
    not have to load that library to determine the window system or term
    type under which Hyperbole is run.

* hyperbole.el: Centralized all Hyperbole system autoloads here.
    Moved message system and window configuration autoloads from
    "hinit.el" to here.  Moved Smart Key autoloads from "hui-mouse.el" to
    here.  Moved key bindings from "hsite-ex.el" here so only need to load
    "hsite.el" if a Hyperbole command is invoked, either from the mouse or
    the keyboard.

* kotl/: Replaced V2 koutliner with V3, largely rewritten internally for
  reliability and speed.

Mon May  2 18:44:35 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hpath.el (hpath:ange-ftp-at-p): 
           (hpath:ange-ftp-p):     Fixed bug that allowed whitespace and
    other characters in user name to match.  This came out when W3 link
    names matched as ange-ftp paths.

Tue Apr 19 18:30:14 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui-window.el (sm-mouse-x/y-drag-sensitivity): Upped to 5 and 3
    respectively since novice users would inadvertently split windows via
    drags when they were trying to click and then would have no idea what
    they did.  All they knew was that they didn't like the result.  This
    makes it harder for such problems to occur.

Wed Apr 13 17:07:10 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hmouse-doc.txt: 
  hmouse-tag.el:
  hypb.texi:       Updated doc for smart-asm, smart-c and smart-c++ to
    reference include-dir variables so that users will have some way to know
    to set them.

Thu Apr  7 17:20:06 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hmouse-drv.el (smart-key-meta-help): Fixed bug in its interactive spec.

* MANIFEST:
  hsys-w3.el: Added to support following of URLs (WWW links) from any buffer.
* hpath.el (hpath:www-at-p): Added optional include-start-and-end-p flag

    there is no need to include it within autoload definitions, so it was
    removed.

* wrolo.el (rolo-display-matches): Improved code and fixed bug under Lucid
    Emacs which permitted display of rolodex buffer in some screen other
    than the selected one.  Had to conditionalized for Lucid Emacs since
    it requires an optional parameter to pop-to-buffer to limit it to the
    selected screen.
           (rolo-kill): Rewrote to remove compiler warnings.

* hyperbole.el: Added autoloads for all commands called from Hyperbole

    Added for use in kotl-mode:transpose-lines command.

                    (kotl-mode:forward-char): Fixed bug that allowed
    movement of point one character beyond the end of the last cell.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:valid-position-p): Renamed from

    mark.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:forward): Fixed bug that moved point to last
    cell of subtree when a following cell at same level was not found.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:delete-horizontal-space): 
                    (kotl-mode:delete-blank-lines): 
                    (kotl-mode:just-one-space): 
		    (kotl-mode:zap-to-char): 
    Added to overload standard functions.  These functions apply only to
    the current cell.
                    (kotl-mode:to-valid-position): Fixed bug which skipped

    occur after point had past the search bound already, triggering an
    error.

Wed Mar  2 15:32:16 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hactypes.el (exec-window-cmd): Fixed so display does not change when
    shell is started and sit-for is reached.  Also, ensured that message
    describing the command executed stays around through the end of the
    action.

* hypb.el (hypb:window-list): Fixed bug under Emacs 19 that caused some
    window side drags to fail since windows in all frames were considered.

Sun Feb 27 18:02:24 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui.el (hui:buf-writable-err): Added conditional to deal with
    vc-toggle-read-only key binding in Emacs V19.
    Also, removed check for unwritable file, since since some people want
    to be able to create buttons within files which they have purposely
    marked read-only.

* hmail.el (hmail:compose): Slight mod to send arguments to mail functions
    when possible, rather than inserting them into the mail buffer.
           (hmail:init-function): Added this variable.  Setting it tells
    hactypes::link-to-mail which mail reader to use, if user has not
    already invoked one.  See its documentation for valid values.

Thu Feb 24 16:37:09 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

    with attached files.

* hmouse-key.el:
  hui-mouse.el:
  hui-window.el:  Removed all references to hyperb:lemacs-early-p since
    no one should have such an early version of Lemacs anymore.  If they
    do, they should upgrade.

* hsite-ex.el: (hyperb:lemacs-p)
               (hyperb:emacs19-p)
               (hyperb:epoch-p):    Moved definitions to hversion.el so
    can use these settings without loading all of Hyperbole.  Also
    eliminated need to duplicate them in "hmouse-key.el".
  hypb.el:  Added (require 'hversion) since it uses the variables set there.
* hyperbole.el: Added autoloads for all wrolo commands.  This allows
    removal of (require 'wrolo) in hui-menus.el.

Wed Feb 23 00:41:39 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:kotl-p): Fixed test for Lemacs 19.9 or above.

    window-start to fix bug that sometimes causes window-start to change
    when a save of an outline is done.

Mon Feb 21 12:06:16 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui-le-but.el
  hui-em19-b.el (le:cycle-but-color): 
                (le:but-flash): 
		(ep:select-line):
		(le:select-item):   Changed sit-for to wait for 0 seconds
    to avoid any floating point issues.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Added a check to prevent matches to e-mail
    addresses like <user@domain>.

Tue Feb 15 11:08:10 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

                (le:foreground): Modified to deal with bug in GNU Emacs
    19.22 which returns nil for default font background and foreground
    colors.

* hsmail.el (mail-yank-original): Updated to work pretty much as Emacs 19
    does with yank and citation hooks.

Mon Feb 14 16:04:54 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hsite-ex.el (hpath:find-alist): Added sample Postscript file viewer under X.

* hpath.el (hpath:find-program): Modified to permit filename use within
    the middle of the program command if program includes %s in its string.
           (hpath:find): Modified to accept hpath:find-program result
    which now includes entire program invocation line.

Tue Feb  8 09:57:51 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui.el (hui:hbut-help): Made ibtypes with their own :help functions
    automatically flash their buttons when selected, if their type
    definitions indicate a button label.
* hbut.el (htype:names): Fixed bug in which arg 'sym' was handled
    improperly when it contained a type category prefix.  This showed up
    when doc-id ibtypes did not show their card catalog entries as part of
    their doc-id:help command.
          (hbut:report): Attributes are now stored in reverse order, so must
    print them all in report, rather than trying to hide internal
    attributes as before.

Mon Feb  7 18:01:43 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:narrow-to-kcells): Conditionalized so is a no-op if
    called in a non-outline buffer.  This allows it to be used in
    'after-save-hook'.
* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Added 2nd optional argument,
    contents, so can fill in contents at create time.
                    (kotl-mode:split-cell): Rewrote to not use kill ring.
		    (after-save-hook): Set to call kfile:narrow-to-kcells
    to ensure that view is always narrowed properly after a save.
    (Without this, if a save is done right after a cell is added at the
    end of a kotl, the view is not narrowed properly, due to some problem
    with save-restriction in basic-save-buffer.

Thu Feb  3 14:13:00 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:update): Added visible-only-p option and turned
    narrowing of view off by default since this interfered with saving an
    outline.
    (kfile:narrow-to-kcells): Made this interactive so could be bound to a
    key in case view is ever widened so that structure data is showing.
    This will narrow the view properly.
    (kfile:narrow-to-kcells): Stopped this from moving point.

Wed Feb  2 00:43:33 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@localhost)

* kotl/kimport.el: Added to import other tree-structured file formats into
    outlines.  Initial support for Emacs '*' outlines and Augment files

  kotl/kview.el (kview:set-buffer-name): Removed call to rename-buffer,
    this is done elsewhere.  This fixes bug that gives you a buf<2> buffer
    name after doing a kfile:write.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (write-contents-hooks): Set this hook to update
    outline structure whenever a save-buffer is done.
                    (kotl-mode:update-buffer): Added this function and
    used in write-contents-hooks.
                    (kotl-mode:save-buffer): Deleted this function.  Use
    normal save buffer now.

* kotl/kfile.el: (kfile:update): Added to update file structure in
    preparation for file save but does not do a save.  Appropriate for
    use in write-contents-hooks.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:split-cell): Added to split a cell in two
    and to move to new cell and bound to {C-c s}.
                    (kotl-mode-map): Moved 'kview:set-label-type' off {C-c
    s} to {C-c C-l}.
  kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl: Changed references of {C-c s} and {C-c C-l}.
  hypb.texi:         Changed same key bindings and added doc for
    kotl-mode:split-cell.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:save-buffer): Renamed to this from
    kotl-mode:save and overloaded standard Emacs function.

* hpath.el (hpath:ange-ftp-p): 
           (hpath:ange-ftp-at-p):
           (hpath:at-p): 
	   (hpath:is-p):          Modified to ignore non-ftp (other
    protocol) WWW link refs.
           (hpath:www-at-p): 
	   (hpath:www-p):         Added these two functions to detect WWW
    link refs.
           (hpath:absolute-to):
	   (hpath:substitute-var):

    creating a klink to a referent in a directory different than the klink
    source.
* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): Added use of default-dir when reading a klink arg.

Tue Feb  1 21:32:51 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@localhost)

* kotl/kview.el (kview:idstamp-to-label): Added to convert idstamp to its
    relative label within current view.

* kotl/kotl.el (kcell:ref-to-id): Fixed minor doc errors.

    Used within klink implicit button type.
                (klink:act):
                (klink:replace-label):
                (klink:update-label):  Added these functions to allow

* hpath.el (hpath:symlink-referent): Simplified and fixed bug that led to
    a/b/b/c pathname in a button link when a/b/c was the target.  Changed
    interface to *not* expand pathnames that are not links.

* hypb.texi (Outliner Keys): Deleted descriptions of overloads of standard
    emacs editing keys.  These are transparent to the user.

    and lbl-end when all args are sent as a single list, as the doc explains.
          (ibut:at-p): Fixed bug that prevented display of implicit button
    help.  (hattr:clear) was called when 'key-only' argument was t, in

    been reported by a user.

* hbdata.el - hbdata:apply-entry - Removed save-restriction which worked
    improperly when button data buffer was modified because of a button
    deletion.  Instead added an (hmail:editor-p) conditional which hides

* hypb.el - hypb:domain-name - Added (getenv "DOMAINNAME") to allow manual
    setting of Internet domainname for systems which do not have proper
    configurations, such as my own.  cs.uiuc.edu would be a valid setting
    for this variable, for example.

Wed Jan 19 15:50:16 1994  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hactypes.el - exec-window-cmd - Changed 'save-excursion' to
   'save-window-excursion' so that shell buffer is not displayed.

    replacement when given an absolute path to test against, since relative
    paths can cause too many undesirable results.

* hpath.el - hpath:substitute-dir - Added conditional that prevents error if
    VAR-NAME value is a list which contains nil entries as sometimes happens
    with variables such as exec-path.

Wed Dec 29 11:40:46 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

    sent.  This prevented the use of regular Emacs Lisp functions in
    Hyperbole actions (calls to 'hact').
          - ibut:at-p - Fixed bug that assumed all actype args were Hyperbole
    action types.

* hypb.texi - Action Types - Added description of Hyperbole interactive
    command extension 'K', which takes a kcell identifier.

* hpath.el - hpath:find
             hpath:find-other-window - Extended to support '-', '!', '&'
    special prefix characters in front of pathnames.

* hui.el - hui:link-directly
           hui:htype-help    - Changed use of 'variable-documentation' to
   'documentation' since Hyperbole types are now defined as functions.
   This was visible as a bug when trying to display the doc for any type,
   no output would appear.

    for kotl-mode.

Sat Nov 20 16:54:21 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@localhost)

    system, notably NEXTSTEP.

* hvm.el - Vm-Summ-goto - Changed from a 'defun' to an 'fset' which is
    what it should have been.  This was visible as a bug when a primary
    Smart Key click in a VM summary buffer did nothing.
         - Vm-Summ-delete - Added call to (vm-follow-summary-cursor) so
    that message summary line clicked upon is the one that is deleted.

Thu Nov 11 12:33:04 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

    'define-key'.

* hui-menus.el - hui:menu - Rewrote once again in a simpler fashion.
    Should solve problems of error messages sometimes showing up only as
    "error".
               - hui:menu-mode-map - Added key binding for left mouse
    button under Lemacs since default binding is broken under V19.8.

* htz.el - htz:zone-to-hour - Fixed to deal with V19 current-time-zone
    function which returns a list.  Also added error message if called with a
    null argument (used to return 0 in this case which would just cover up
    timezone problems).

* hargs.el - hargs:iforms - Modified 'I' component to utilize
    V19 Info-directory-list if bound.

Tue Nov  9 19:08:05 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hui-em19-b.el - Added color support for GNU Emacs 19 under NEXTSTEP (the
    Display Postscript window system).

* hmouse-tag.el - smart-c
                  smart-c++ - Fixed bug that caused immediate return if
   non-nil 'identifier' was sent in when function was called.

                  smart-c
                  smart-c++
                  smart-lisp - Changed so that 'tags-file-name' is set

    variables to match variable name.

* hsite-ex.el
  hinit.el - hyperb:init - Removed find-file-hooks setup of button
    highlighting and moved it to hsite-ex.el so that it may be customized
    for a site.

Thu Oct  7 11:10:15 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hact.el - action:commandp
            action:params    - Rewrote to handle autoload functions.

* hypb.el - hypb:indirect-function - Added and replaced all calls to
    'symbol-function' in Hyperbole with this instead, so if symbol has
    more than one level of indirection, things will work.

* hypb.el - hypb:debug - Updated to deal with V19 byte codes. 

Wed Oct  6 11:41:23 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

	    htype:create - Modified to use obarray.
	  - htype:category - Added to return all type symbols within a
    category.

==============================================================================

Tue Sep 21 12:23:36 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

* hinit.el - Added require of 'hui since had removed this from
    hui-menus.el so that it could be loaded independently of hui.el.

* hbut.el - htype:create - Updated to support byte-compiling of values
    within property-list which are functions.
          - ibtype:create - Changed to support modified htype:create.
	  - ibut:at-p - Changed 'eval' of at-p to 'funcall' to support

Wed Sep 15 14:43:04 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

* hactypes.el - link-to-mail - Handled error where mail reader has not been
    invoked so link-to-mail does not know which mail reader to use to display
    the linked message.

* hpath.el - hpath:is-p - Fixed bug manifested in hui:link-possible-types
    which allowed a string such as "this is a string" to match as a pathname.
    This was due to the fact that in general, we want to allow spaces in
    pathnames.

* hui.el - hui:ebut-unmark - Modified so that if explicit button delete
    command is called with a prefix argument, then the button label is also
    deleted from the text.  (Normally only the button delimiters are removed.)

* hui-menus.el  - hui:menu-lemacs - Added this function to convert from
    Hyperbole menu format to Lucid Emacs menus format.  Thanks to Guido
    Bosch for the idea.

  hactypes.el - completion - Added to insert entries from  " *Completions*" buffer.

    so that if a pathname exists in the minibuffer, completion is simply
    appended to it.
    Also fixed bug in directory reading section where default-directory was
    referred to as a function rather than a variable.
             hargs:completion - Added to return and optionally insert
    argument completion at point.  Used in hargs:at-p for completion handling.

* hactypes.el - hyp-source - Fixed to accomodate new Lemacs buffer object
    print form, which includes double quotes around the buffer name.

    displayed then a buffer menu is displayed or hidden (toggles).  (The
    Smart Menu package has not yet been released.)

* hui-window.el - sm-mouse-side-sensitivity - Increased to 2 to handle window
    side-by-side window resizing when scroll bars are active by depressing
    just to the left of the scroll bar and then dragging, under GNU Emacs 19.
* hmouse-key.el - sm-mouse-setup - Added vertical-line bindings for GNU Emacs V19
    to handle side-by-side window resizes properly when vertical scroll bars
    are turned off.
                                   Also unbound local [mouse-2] (Emacs 19)
    and button2 and button3 (Lemacs) in Info-mode so Hyperbole would handle
    following Info nodes.
                                   Unbound button3 in mode-line-map (Lemacs)
    so Hyperbole can use this key.

* hui-mouse.el - smart-gnus-summary* - Updated doc to reflect actual function
    behavior.

Wed Jul 28 15:28:31 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@sun285)

* hmouse-key.el - sm-window-sys-term - Modified so when run from an X term
    returns non-nil only if (eq window-system 'x).  This prevents attempts to

    ignore outline-minor-mode when hyperb:lemacs-early-p is non-nil.

Tue Jul 20 13:25:26 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

  hsmail.el - mail-yank-original

    for use in predicates since (mark) can signal an error under Emacs19
    instead of returning an int or nil as we want.

* hui-window.el - smart-window-of-coords
                  smart-coords-in-window-p - Changed hyperb:emacs19-p conditionals
    so works if Emacs19 is run under a non-X window system, e.g. NeXTSTEP.

Wed Jun 30 13:36:18 1993  Bob Weiner  (weiner@info)

* set.el   - set:union - Fixed missing setq bug in set:union.

* hsite-ex.el
  hmouse-key.el - Redefined hyperb:emacs19-p so is not true when running

* hibtypes.el - dir-summary - Added this implicit button type

* hargs.el - hargs:iform-read - Fixed handling of null default values
               so are not converted to strings.  This showed up as a

	       when prompting for a file or directory name.
* MANIFEST -   Updated with hib-kbd.el, refs-DEMO, hypb.texinfo.
* hactypes.el - link-to-ebut - Fixed missing paren bug in interactive
                  calling spec.

		  used in newer versions of Info.
* hpath.el    - hpath:absolute-to - Modified to allow a list of directories
	          to look for file in.
* hbut.el - ibut:at-p - Added setting of 'loc' attribute for display
	      when reporting on implicit buttons.
            hbut:source - Corrected to handle quotes around file names.

	      when non-nil returns a list including button start and end
	      positions rather than just the label or lbl-key.
* hibtypes.el - annot-bib - Corrected so returns proper key.
                pathname  - Added new ibtype that recognizes pathnames.

		sendmail.el package see no behavior change.
* hui.el - hui:ebut-buf - Modified to not drop '*mail*' mail composition
	     buffer from list of potential button buffers.
* hib-kbd.el - Added this file; makes brace delimited key sequences function
    as implicit buttons.
* hibtypes.el - Required hib-kbd.
* hbut.el - Added hbut:{key-src,key-to-label,label-p,label-to-key} aliases
	      for ebut: functions of same name since these are now used
	      for more than explicit buttons.
          - ebut:label-p - modified doc to account for this change.
* hbut.el - ebut:label-p - Modified to allow '\' quoting of button delim
	      chars for use in labels.
	      Also fixed bug where if multiple open delimiters preceded an end
	      delimiter, first open delimiter was chosen rather than innermost.
	      Nesting of buttons is not allowed.

Thu Nov 21 17:03:17 1991  Bob Weiner  (rsw at betty)

* hbut.el - hattr:summarize - Renamed to 'hattr:report'.
	  - hbut:summarize  - Renamed to 'hbut:report'
